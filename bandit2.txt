# This room focuses of a similar filename problem which is spaces in the filename
# Like we did before we take the  password from the previous room and login into the new room
# After we ls in the cwd(current working directory) we see a filename with spaces when we try to open
# it just like earlier we cant because cat/nano assumes spaces as spaces between 2 different files
# So we did some googling and found out that \ can be used to treat spaces as spaces in the filename
# and not seperator between different files(Google spaces between files)
