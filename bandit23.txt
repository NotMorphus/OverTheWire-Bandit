# This task is similar to previous task just that we have to write a script which cats the password file
# in etc to our temp file and that put that script in /var/spool so that executes every minute
# We get the password copied to our temp file and then we go to the next room
# make sure to check the permissions of the file to write so that other users can also execute and 
# write to the file
