# We have to learn how to ssh into a machine(man ssh or ssh help)
# First we install ssh using sudo apt-get install ssh
# Then we are asked to login to a particular domain using specific port and username/passowrd combination
# which will grant you access to the machine 
# In there after you ls(list) on the current working directory you will find a readme file
# Using cat we check the contents of the file and find the flag required for the next level
