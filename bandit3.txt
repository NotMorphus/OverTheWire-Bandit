# In this room we are given a task to find out hidden files in the directory
# If we look at the ls command (man ls or ls help) we see that -a gives you hidden files present
# in the directory thus we do ls -la
# We get a file named hidden with a dot in the front (Google hidden files in linux)
# We cat like we usually do and get the password for the next room
